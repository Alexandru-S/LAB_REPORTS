The current problem facing institutions is an exponential increase in operational cost and competiton. Academic Institutions do not have the resources and funding of big pharma but are continuously expected to outperform the market and impress with bigger and newer discoveries. 
Our platform aims to help researchers be more in depth but also flexible in how they wish to capture the data. No lnger being tied to laptops, the platform will use smart phones to connect researchers with their test grous. Be it either through continuous daily tracking of vital signs using wearable devices such as jaw bone or apple watch or through daily memos using photos or videos. The platform aims to drastically decrease the cost of performing such research while increasing the amount and type of data that can be collected. 
By using the smart phone in every persons pocket the platform can increase the speed and reach of data collection while dramatically reducing costs
